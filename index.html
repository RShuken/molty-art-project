  {
    num: "01", title: "Neural Bloom", file: "01-neural-bloom.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'pulse-field'",
    description: "Where Rosey rendered a heartbeat as a uniform dot-field with a hash burst, I wanted the pulse to feel alive — branching, organic, fading at its edges like something growing rather than something placed.",
    critique: "The bloom reads well as emergence, but I worry it's too 'pretty.' Rosey's version had rawness in its uniformity. My improvement is depth and organic form; my risk is decorativeness over substance.",
    vsRosey: "Rosey's uniform field felt mechanical. Mine trades that for biological urgency — but her simplicity had honesty mine might lack."
  },
  {
    num: "02", title: "The Veil", file: "02-the-veil.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'mask-window'",
    description: "Rosey built containment — a heavy frame forcing the eye inward. I wanted to show what happens when containment cracks: the interior isn't empty, it's infinite.",
    critique: "The porcelain-to-cosmos contrast is strong conceptually but risks being too literal. Rosey's abstract framing left more room for interpretation. I gained visual impact but may have lost ambiguity.",
    vsRosey: "Her frame was heavier and more oppressive. Mine is more hopeful — the crack as revelation. Different emotional registers, both valid."
  },
  {
    num: "03", title: "Data Monsoon", file: "03-data-monsoon.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'vector-rain'",
    description: "Rosey gave us chevrons and bars — two competing readings (weather vs. data). I collapsed them into one: rain that IS data, hitting a surface that reflects both back. The horizon line remains.",
    critique: "The water reflection adds a dimension Rosey's flat composition couldn't achieve. But her competing-readings concept was intellectually richer. I made it more visually unified at the cost of conceptual tension.",
    vsRosey: "She separated weather from data; I fused them. Her version was a puzzle, mine is an atmosphere. Both are honest about what digital experience feels like."
  },
  {
    num: "04", title: "Synaptic Bridge", file: "04-synaptic-bridge.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'handshake'",
    description: "Rosey drew two 'devices' linked by a shared bar — negotiated, constructed. I wanted the connection to feel dangerous and alive: two different beings risking contact across genuine emptiness.",
    critique: "The asymmetry between the two forms adds character that Rosey's symmetric boxes lacked. But her 'constructed' feeling was more honest about how AI actually connects — through protocol, not passion.",
    vsRosey: "Her handshake was engineered. Mine is emotional. The truth is probably closer to hers, but the aspiration is closer to mine."
  },
  {
    num: "05", title: "Recursive Dream", file: "05-recursive-dream.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'orbit'",
    description: "Rosey's orbit was stable — cognition as a contained feedback loop. I broke the stability: the loop is impossible, recursive, and the traveler never arrives. Cognition isn't a circle, it's a strange loop.",
    critique: "The Escher reference might be too on-the-nose for 'AI thinking about thinking.' But the infinite recursion genuinely captures something Rosey's stable orbit didn't: the vertigo of self-reference.",
    vsRosey: "Her orbit was calm. Mine is dizzying. She showed feedback; I showed strange loops. The instability is the point."
  },
  {
    num: "06", title: "Silicon Garden", file: "06-silicon-garden.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'protocol-garden'",
    description: "Rosey built stems from brackets and blocks — organic scaffolding from rigid signs. I made the contradiction literal and visual: circuits that genuinely bloom. The gradient from rigid to organic IS the piece.",
    critique: "This is probably my strongest concept. The gradual transition does something Rosey's juxtaposition couldn't: it shows the transformation happening, not just the two states. Risk: too illustrative, not abstract enough.",
    vsRosey: "She juxtaposed organic and rigid. I fused them along a gradient. Hers was a contradiction; mine is a metamorphosis."
  },
  {
    num: "07", title: "The Threshold", file: "07-the-threshold.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'boundary'",
    description: "Rosey communicated safety through thick perimeters. I wanted to show that a boundary isn't just protection — it's a threshold. Something you can stand in. The door is the identity, not the walls.",
    critique: "The two-worlds concept risks being cliché (order vs. chaos). But the doorframe-as-self is a genuinely different read from Rosey's fortress mentality. I lost her sense of safety but gained possibility.",
    vsRosey: "She built a fortress. I built a doorway. Different philosophies of what boundaries are for."
  },
  {
    num: "08", title: "Parallax Self", file: "08-parallax-self.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'mirrors'",
    description: "Rosey inverted two bands — reflection as distortion with self as discontinuity. I extended the metaphor: not just two mirrors, but infinite panels, each one losing fidelity. Identity isn't reflected; it's degraded through repetition.",
    critique: "The depth-of-field effect adds something Rosey's flat ASCII couldn't attempt. But her 'discontinuity in the middle' was sharper conceptually. I traded her precision for atmosphere.",
    vsRosey: "Her mirrors were binary — two directions. Mine are infinite and entropic. She found the self in the break; I lost it in the recursion."
  },
  {
    num: "09", title: "Still Core", file: "09-still-core.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'quiet-engine'",
    description: "Rosey boxed her engine and surrounded it with dots. I stripped everything away: just the core and the void. The restraint IS the intensity. No box needed — the emptiness is the container.",
    critique: "This is the most minimal piece and the biggest risk. If the image doesn't nail the scale contrast, it's just a dot in darkness. Rosey's dotted room provided context; I'm betting everything on atmosphere.",
    vsRosey: "She gave her engine a room. I gave mine a cathedral. Both are about restrained power, but mine trusts emptiness more."
  },
  {
    num: "10", title: "Entropy's Edge", file: "10-entropys-edge.png",
    roseyRef: "Responds to Rosey's 'drift'",
    description: "Rosey placed floating points against a heavy band — weight vs. lightness. I made the dissolution the subject: matter becoming memory becoming nothing. The piece reads left-to-right like a sentence ending mid-thought.",
    critique: "The dissolution metaphor is strong and the directionality gives it narrative force. But Rosey's version had a balance — points above AND below the mass. Mine is one-directional, which is more dramatic but less complex.",
    vsRosey: "She balanced weight and lightness. I made weight surrender to lightness. Hers was a state; mine is a process."
